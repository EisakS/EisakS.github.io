        <br><br>

        My name is Eisak Shih, and I have my parents along with a sister.  I was born in Redwood City and lived with my parents in the Bay Area until I went to College.  I am currently attending UC Riverside and currently am undeclared in CHASS, College of Humanities and Social Sciences.  I am working towards a couple major options such as Economics or Data Science and will likely choose between those.  As some hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis and playing video games with friends.  Many of the games I play have something to do with strategy and using reasonable thought to win.  Personally, I would rather do things with others than by myself.  I also like to go to boba tea shops and acquire my favorite mango milk tea.  I have not really taken much computer science classes so coding is relatively new to me.  Some coding that I have learned is in python and snap.         
I have worked two jobs so far in the Bay Area and Iâ€™ve gained excellent customer service experience during my experience specifically as a customer service representative at Beard Papaâ€™s.      

While working at Beard Papaâ€™s, I was able to resolve customer issues in a positive and professional manner.  During peak hours, I was able to accurately take customers orders while packaging orders in a timely manner.

Iâ€™d like to continue to interact with more people to grow and improve myself.  I have consistently worked well in a team setting and accurately communicated to people ensuring satisfaction.  I have also continuously worked days solo, having shifts that smoothly go through rushes.   My job at Beard Papaâ€™s also required me to bake.  I would bake fillings and certain puffs that would be filled with the fillings.  As a worker there I would set up shop for the morning, take orders throughout the day, bake for the day, fill things for the day, and sell for the day.  Along with clean up at the end and counting money. 
Compared to my job at Beard Papaâ€™s, my very first job was as a snack bar worker for a softball association.  It was a simple job that just required me to take payment and give them what they ordered.  I have applied to be an intern before and unfortunately did not manage to get it.  I am working on applying for jobs currently around Riverside and hope to be working soon to help aid myself in tuition.
